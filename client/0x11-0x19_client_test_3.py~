    This test simulates an advanced conversation between two users.
    
    It does the following:
      1. Connects two clients and creates (or logs into) two accounts ("coolUserA" and "coolUserB").
      2. Verifies that the accounts exist.
      3. Sends multiple messages from coolUserA to coolUserB and vice versa.
      4. Retrieves the conversation from coolUserA's perspective and checks the expected number of messages.
      5. Prints details (including sender flags) for each message.
      6. Uses a wildcard account search (e.g. "cool") to verify both accounts are found.
      7. Deletes one of coolUserA's messages and verifies that the conversation is updated.
      8. Finally, deletes both accounts and disconnects the clients.
