    This test simulates an advanced conversation between two users.
    
    It does the following:
      1. Connects two clients and creates (or logs into) two accounts ("coolUserA" and "coolUserB").
      2. Verifies that the accounts exist.
      3. Sends multiple messages from coolUserA to coolUserB and vice versa.
      4. Retrieves the conversation from coolUserA's perspective and prints out details.
      5. Marks all messages as read.
      6. Uses a wildcard account search to verify both accounts are found.
      7. Deletes one of coolUserA's messages and uses get_message_info to confirm that the deleted message is no longer retrievable.
      8. Finally, deletes both accounts and disconnects the clients.
